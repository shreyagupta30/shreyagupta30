### Hi there 👋

I am Shreya Gupta. Thanks for dropping by! I am incoming outreachy intern @Fedora for winter cohort 2020. I love programming and Python is my go to langauge. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a side project. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust for outreachy internship. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any FOSS projects with backend requirements in Python.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with good study materials for learning rust. 
- 💬 Ask me about good rock music recommendation and Web technologies. We can always discuss Sci-Fi movies and shows.
